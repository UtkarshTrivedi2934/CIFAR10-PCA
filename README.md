# CIFAR10-PCA
-CIFAR-10, short for the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research - 10, is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with each class representing a distinct object or animal category.
-The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, making it suitable for evaluating the performance of image classification algorithms.
-Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to CIFAR-10 involves transforming the pixel values of the images into a new set of uncorrelated variables, the principal components. This process helps in visualizing and understanding the intrinsic structure of the data, facilitating more efficient and effective feature extraction for classification tasks. Additionally, PCA can be instrumental in mitigating the curse of dimensionality, improving model generalization, and accelerating training times.
